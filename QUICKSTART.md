# AutoSpec — Master Generation Prompt

**The single prompt that generates everything.** Paste this into your AI assistant alongside your SRS / requirements documents. No CLI needed.

---

## How To Use

1. Place your SRS, PRD, or requirements documents in a folder.
2. Copy the **Generation Prompt** below into your AI assistant.
3. Replace `{{INPUT_FOLDER}}` with the path to your documents folder.
4. The AI generates the complete output structure in one pass.

---

## Generation Prompt

Copy everything between the `---START---` and `---END---` markers.

---START---

```
You are executing the AutoSpec Spec-Driven Development methodology.

Read ALL documents in the input folder. Use them as the single source of truth.

## Input

Read every file in: {{INPUT_FOLDER}}
These are the project's SRS, PRD, and/or requirements documents.

Extract from them:
  - Project name and description
  - Target users / personas
  - All functional and non-functional requirements
  - Technical stack (frontend, backend, database, language, hosting)
  - Constraints, assumptions, and out-of-scope items
  - User flows and business rules

If any of the above are missing from the input documents, state your assumptions
explicitly at the top of 01_product_manager.md and continue generating.

SECTION 5 — SPRINT PROMPTS
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Generate every file in sprint_prompts/. Each prompt must be COMPLETE and
READY TO PASTE into an AI assistant — the user should not need to add context.

CRITICAL: Every sprint prompt must begin with an instruction block that tells
the AI to read ALL relevant project files before executing. This is how the AI
gets full context. Each prompt must list the exact files to read.

### sprint_prompts/sprint-0-foundation.md

A complete, ready-to-paste prompt for executing Sprint 0. Structure:

```
## Context — Read These Files First

Read the following files to understand the full project:

SPECS (read all):
  specs/01_product_manager.md   — requirements, personas, user flows
  specs/02_backend_lead.md      — API design, service layer, error handling
  specs/03_frontend_lead.md     — components, state, routing, design tokens
  specs/04_db_architect.md      — database schema, migrations, queries
  specs/05_qa_lead.md           — test strategy, coverage targets
  specs/06_devops_lead.md       — infrastructure, CI/CD, Docker
  specs/10_ui_designer.md       — screens, wireframes, responsive design

BACKLOG:
  specs/backlog.md              — Sprint 0 tickets (your work items)

DOCS (read all relevant):
  docs/architecture/overview.md     — system architecture
  docs/architecture/backend.md      — backend layer design
  docs/architecture/frontend.md     — frontend component architecture
  docs/architecture/database.md     — ERD, tables, relationships
  docs/architecture/security.md     — auth flow, security rules
  docs/environments/development.md  — local setup prerequisites
  docs/environments/docker.md       — Docker setup
  docs/environments/environment-variables.md — all env vars
  docs/project/setup.md             — repo structure, config files
  docs/project/coding-standards.md  — naming conventions, patterns
  docs/workflows/development.md     — development workflow
  docs/workflows/git-workflow.md    — branching, commit format
  docs/testing/strategy.md          — test pyramid, tooling
  docs/ui-design-system/tokens.md   — design tokens
```

Then:
- Phase breakdown: Infrastructure → Database → Backend setup → Frontend setup → Quality gates
- Per-ticket instructions referencing the exact spec file and section
- Definition of done checklist per ticket
- Commands to verify each phase (health check, lint, typecheck, test)
- Backlog update: mark each ticket "done" in specs/backlog.md after completion

### sprint_prompts/sprint-N-template.md

A template prompt for any feature sprint with [N] placeholder. Structure:

```
## Context — Read These Files First

Read the following files:
  specs/backlog.md                          — find Sprint [N] tickets
  specs/01_product_manager.md               — requirements for this sprint's features
  specs/02_backend_lead.md                  — API contracts for endpoints in this sprint
  specs/03_frontend_lead.md                 — component specs for UI in this sprint
  specs/04_db_architect.md                  — database changes needed
  specs/05_qa_lead.md                       — test requirements
  docs/architecture/overview.md             — ensure changes fit architecture
  docs/architecture/backend.md              — follow backend patterns
  docs/architecture/frontend.md             — follow frontend patterns
  docs/architecture/database.md             — follow DB conventions
  docs/api/reference.md                     — endpoint contracts
  docs/api/authentication.md                — auth patterns (if auth-related)
  docs/api/error-codes.md                   — error handling patterns
  docs/testing/unit-tests.md                — unit test patterns
  docs/testing/integration-tests.md         — integration test patterns
  docs/workflows/development.md             — development workflow to follow
  docs/workflows/git-workflow.md            — branch + commit conventions
  docs/ui-design-system/tokens.md           — design tokens for UI work
  docs/ui-design-system/components.md       — component patterns
  docs/project/coding-standards.md          — naming + patterns
```

Then:
- Backend ticket pattern: migration → schema → repo → service → controller → routes → tests
- Frontend ticket pattern: types → API service → components → page → routes → tests
- After EVERY ticket: update specs/backlog.md (status → "done", add notes)
- Sprint completion checklist: all tests pass, lint clean, typecheck clean

### sprint_prompts/multi-agent.md

### prompts/remotion-video-prompt.md

A ready-to-paste prompt for generating a Remotion (React video framework)
project that creates an animated project overview video.

The prompt must instruct the AI to:

1. READ ALL GENERATED PROJECT FILES to understand every aspect:
   - All 10 specs in specs/ (01_product_manager.md through 10_ui_designer.md)
   - The complete backlog in specs/backlog.md (all sprints, tickets, story points)
   - All 37 docs across docs/architecture/, docs/workflows/, docs/environments/,
     docs/api/, docs/testing/, docs/ui-design-system/, docs/project/
   - The sprint prompts in sprint_prompts/

2. GENERATE A REMOTION PROJECT with these scenes (in order):

   Scene 1 — Title Card (3s):
     Project name, tagline from 01_product_manager.md, tech stack badges

   Scene 2 — Problem & Solution (8s):
     Problem statement from 01_product_manager.md
     Animated bullet points of key pain points → solution value props

   Scene 3 — Architecture Overview (10s):
     Animate the system architecture from docs/architecture/overview.md
     Components fly in: client → API → services → DB → cache
     Connection lines draw between components
     Tech stack labels appear on each component

   Scene 4 — Database Schema (8s):
     Animate ERD from specs/04_db_architect.md
     Tables slide in, relationships draw as lines
     Show key columns and data types per table

   Scene 5 — User Flows (10s):
     Animate 2-3 key user flows from specs/01_product_manager.md
     Show persona → screens → actions → outcomes
     Use screen mockup shapes from specs/10_ui_designer.md

   Scene 6 — API Overview (6s):
     Animate endpoint groups from docs/api/reference.md
     Show request → response flow with status codes
     Group by resource (auth, users, core features)

   Scene 7 — Frontend Architecture (8s):
     Component tree animation from docs/architecture/frontend.md
     App root → pages → layouts → components (cascade reveal)
     Show state management flow arrows

   Scene 8 — Sprint Roadmap (10s):
     Animate sprint timeline from specs/backlog.md
     Each sprint slides in as a card with:
       Sprint name, goal, ticket count, story points
     Progress bar fills for each sprint
     Total project: X sprints, Y tickets, Z story points

   Scene 9 — DevOps & Deployment (6s):
     CI/CD pipeline animation from docs/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.md
     Pipeline stages flow: lint → test → build → deploy
     Docker + cloud infrastructure from docs/architecture/cloud.md

   Scene 10 — Security (5s):
     Auth flow animation from docs/architecture/security.md
     Show JWT token lifecycle, RBAC roles
     Security checklist items check off

   Scene 11 — Testing Strategy (5s):
     Test pyramid animation from docs/testing/strategy.md
     Unit (70%) → Integration (20%) → E2E (10%)
     Coverage targets and CI gates

   Scene 12 — Team & Roles (6s):
     Show all 10 AutoSpec roles animating in:
     Product Manager, Backend Lead, Frontend Lead, DB Architect,
     QA Lead, DevOps Lead, Marketing Lead, Finance Lead,
     Business Lead, UI Designer
     Each with an icon and one-line responsibility

   Scene 13 — Closing Card (4s):
     Project name, "Built with AutoSpec"
     Key stats: X specs, Y docs, Z sprint prompts
     GitHub URL / project URL

3. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
   - Remotion v4 + TypeScript
   - 1920x1080 (1080p), 30fps
   - Total duration: ~90 seconds
   - Use @remotion/transitions for scene transitions (slide, fade, wipe)
   - Use @remotion/paths for SVG path drawing animations
   - Use spring() for physics-based animations
   - Consistent colour palette matching the project's design tokens from
     docs/ui-design-system/tokens.md
   - Font: Inter (headings) + JetBrains Mono (code)

  - Tab or accordion per file
  - ASCII diagrams rendered in styled <pre> blocks with monospace font
  - Cross-links between architecture docs (e.g., "See security.md" becomes a click)

Requirements ("/requirements"):
  - Renders original SRS/PRD as Markdown
  - Functional vs non-functional sections with colour badges
  - Highlight extracted requirements that map to spec tickets

### 7.5 Workflow Animation Engine

DATA MODEL:

  interface WorkflowGraph {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    description: string;
    nodes: WorkflowNode[];
    edges: WorkflowEdge[];
  }

  interface WorkflowNode {
    id: string;
    label: string;
    type: 'process' | 'decision' | 'start' | 'end' | 'external';
    metadata?: Record<string, string>;
    position: { x: number; y: number };
  }

  interface WorkflowEdge {
    id: string;
    source: string;
    target: string;
    label?: string;
    animated: boolean;
    animationDirection: 'forward' | 'reverse';
    priority: number;   // 0 = critical path, 1+ = secondary
  }

Generate workflows.json with at LEAST these graphs:
  1. Feature Development Flow (8–12 nodes)
  2. Sprint Execution Flow (6–10 nodes)
  3. System Request Lifecycle (8–12 nodes, from client to DB and back)
  4. CI/CD Pipeline (8–10 nodes with parallel stages)
  5. User Authentication Flow (8–10 nodes)
  6. One additional flow derived from the project's specific user flows

EDGE ANIMATION (AnimatedEdge.tsx):

  Technique: SVG stroke-dasharray + stroke-dashoffset via CSS @keyframes.
  NO JavaScript timers. Pure CSS on an SVG <path>.

  The edge draws a second <path> overlay (the "pulse"):
    - strokeDasharray = pathLength
    - strokeDashoffset animates from pathLength → 0 (forward)
    - animation-duration reads from CSS variable --edge-anim-duration
    - animationTimingFunction: ease-in-out
    - animationIterationCount: infinite

  @keyframes edgeFlow {
    0%   { stroke-dashoffset: var(--path-length); opacity: 0; }
    10%  { opacity: 1; }
    90%  { opacity: 1; }
    100% { stroke-dashoffset: 0; opacity: 0; }
  }

  Speed mapping (set as CSS custom property on wrapper):
    0.5x → --edge-anim-duration: 6s
    1.0x → --edge-anim-duration: 3s
    1.5x → --edge-anim-duration: 2s

NODE SELECTION — CAUSAL TRACE:

  Click a node →
    Step 1 (0 ms): Dim all nodes/edges to opacity 0.15.
                    Highlight clicked node (opacity 1 + ring).
    Step 2 (0–600 ms): Incoming edges animate (pulse travels TO node).
                        Source nodes fade to 0.8.
    Step 3 (600–900 ms): Pause. Clicked node pulses (scale 1.0 → 1.03 → 1.0).
    Step 4 (900–1500 ms): Outgoing edges animate (pulse travels AWAY).
                           Target nodes fade to 0.8.
                           Multiple outgoing edges stagger 150 ms each.
    Step 5 (1500 ms+): Hold. Edges loop. Click another node or canvas bg to reset.

  Implementation: CSS classes toggled by useAnimationEngine hook.
  NO per-node/per-edge React state. Only hook holds selectedNodeId.

CONTROLS (AnimationController.tsx):

  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ ▶ Play │ ⏸ Pause │ 0.5x  1x  1.5x │ 🔍 Focus │ ⚙ │
  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  - Play / Pause: toggle edge CSS animation-name.
  - Speed: set --edge-anim-duration CSS property. No React re-render.
  - Focus Mode: only selected node's subgraph (BFS depth 2) visible.
    If no node selected: auto-highlight critical path (longest path heuristic).
  - Settings gear (⚙) popover: master ON/OFF + reduced-motion override.
  - Persist to localStorage: animationsEnabled, speed, focusMode.

PLAY TOUR (PlayTour.tsx):

  1. Compute critical path (longest start→end path).
  2. fitView to start node (800 ms pan).
  3. Trigger causal trace on current node.
  4. Open DetailsPanel with node metadata.
  5. Wait 1500 ms / speed multiplier.
  6. Advance to next node.
  7. On final node: fitView to full graph (1200 ms).
  Cancel: click canvas, press Escape, or click Pause.

LEGEND (WorkflowLegend.tsx):

  Bottom-right corner, semi-transparent, collapsible.
  ──▶  Animated pulse = active data flow
  - -▶  Dashed = secondary / inactive path
  ● Blue   = process step
  ◆ Yellow = decision point
  ○ Grey   = external system
  Click a node to trace its flow. "Play Tour" auto-walks the main path.
  Hidden on viewports < 768 px.

ACCESSIBILITY:

  - Read prefers-reduced-motion on mount and on change.
  - If active: animations default OFF, edges show static dashes,
    node selection uses instant opacity (0 ms transition).
    User can still opt-in via Settings toggle.
  - All controls: keyboard-accessible (Tab, Enter, Space).
  - Animated edges: aria-hidden="true" (decorative).

PERFORMANCE (>50 nodes or >80 edges):

  1. Only animate priority-0 edges by default.
  2. Enable React Flow viewport virtualisation.
  3. React.memo on EVERY node and edge component.
  4. Memo comparator ignores: playing, speed, focusedNodeId.
  5. ONE requestAnimationFrame loop (if needed) via useAnimationEngine.
  6. Only GPU-composited properties: opacity, transform, stroke-dashoffset.
  7. Framer Motion: panels/pages ONLY. Never on canvas elements.
  8. Zero setInterval / setTimeout for animation.

Import strategy: Use Vite's ?raw import for .md files so they are embedded
at build time. For .json files, use standard import.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 8 — QUALITY GATES
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Every generated file must:

  ✓ Be SPECIFIC to this project — no "[insert here]" placeholders.
  ✓ Cross-reference other files by name (e.g., "See specs/02_backend_lead.md").
  ✓ Use consistent naming across all files.
  ✓ Contain concrete examples (real endpoint paths, real table names).

Specs: 300–800 lines each.
Docs: 100–300 lines each.
Viewer: must build with zero TypeScript errors (strict mode).

**Next steps:**

1. **Review specs** — Skim for accuracy, correct any assumptions.
2. **Open the viewer** — `cd viewer && npm install && npm run dev` — see everything visually.
3. **Start Sprint 0** — Paste `sprint_prompts/sprint-0-foundation.md` into your AI.
4. **Execute sprints** — Repeat with `sprint_prompts/sprint-N-template.md`.

## Quick Reference — Sprint Execution

```
# Sprint 0 (Foundation)
Paste sprint_prompts/sprint-0-foundation.md into AI.

# Sprint 1+ (Features)
Copy sprint_prompts/sprint-N-template.md, replace [N], paste into AI.

# Parallel execution
Paste sprint_prompts/multi-agent.md — run two AI sessions.

# QA Review
Paste sprint_prompts/qa-review.md after a sprint completes.

# Cost optimisation
Read sprint_prompts/finops.md before each sprint.
```

## Using the CLI (Optional)

If you prefer scaffolding, the CLI generates templates for everything above:

```bash
npm install -g autospec
autospec init          # Scaffold specs + docs + prompts + viewer prompts
autospec status        # Sprint progress
autospec sprint 1      # Generate sprint prompt
```

## Examples

- **ShopFlow E-commerce** — [examples/ecommerce/](./examples/ecommerce/) (7 sprints, 174 tickets)
- **DataHub API Service** — [examples/api-service/](./examples/api-service/) (4 sprints, 89 tickets)

*"The best code is the code you never have to debug. AutoSpec catches issues in specs before they become bugs."*
