# Step 1: Review Requirements

## Overview
This step introduces the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) that serves as input to the AutoSpec methodology.

## Source File
The ShopFlow requirements are located at:
```
examples/ecommerce/requirements.md
```

## What to Highlight
When presenting, show these sections:

### 1. Project Vision
- What problem does ShopFlow solve?
- Who are the target users?
- What makes it different?

### 2. Core Features
- User authentication
- Product catalog
- Shopping cart
- Checkout & payments
- Order management
- Admin dashboard

### 3. Technical Requirements
- Tech stack choices
- Performance targets
- Security requirements
- Scalability needs

### 4. Success Metrics
- Conversion rate targets
- Page load time goals
- Uptime requirements

## Key Takeaway
The SRS is the **single source of truth** that all specs will reference. Quality in = Quality out.

## Demo Script

> "Before we generate any specs, we need a solid requirements document. This SRS defines what we're building, who it's for, and what success looks like. AutoSpec will transform this into 10 detailed specifications covering every aspect of the project."

Open `examples/ecommerce/requirements.md` and scroll through the sections.
